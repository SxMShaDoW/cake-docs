### Wallet keys

Your keys encode the private information in your wallet and are what allow you to spend coins and see incoming transactions. You may also use a wallet's keys to restore the wallet.  

General terms specific to public-key cryptography where a private key and a public key make up a keypair. A public key is derived from the private key.  

* The public key is safe to share, and gives the recipient the ability to encrypt something or verify a signature.  
* The private key gives the owner the ability to sign or decrypt something, and as such, should be kept private.

### Wallet seed  

Your seed is just a version of your private key written in a way thatâ€™s easier for you to write down. Your seed and keys are actually the same things, just in different forms! You can use wallet's seed to restore your wallet too.

### Viewing your wallet's seed/keys

Go to the menu at the top-right, click on `Show seed/keys`. You will be prompted for your PIN, biometic authentication, or password. On the next screen, you will see your wallet's seed and keys. Cake Wallet has 1 set of these per wallet, so you must save them all individually.

 If you want to copy your seed/keys, just tap on each of them. **DO NOT show your seed/keys to anyone.** Your funds will likely be stolen if you give out either. Please write down your seed/keys, however, and store it in a safe place. This will allow you to restore your wallet if you lose your device, or otherwise cannot access the wallet.
