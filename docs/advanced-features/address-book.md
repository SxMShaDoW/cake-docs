# Address book

Cake Wallet includes an address book that allows you to easily access your wallet addresses and other saved addresses. Access this by clicking on the hamburger menu in the home screen, then clicking `Address book`.

If your Monero wallet is set to auto generate subaddresses (which it is by default), then the address book will only show one entry per account. This entry will correspond to the first unused address in that account. You can disable this feature in Privacy settings to see all subaddresses for your Monero wallets in the address book.
