For Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Monero, you can manually specify the specific outputs that you would like to spend in a transaction. Coin control can be configured in the send screen.

You can optionally "freeze" specific outputs, which will prevent these outputs from being spent unless unfrozen. If you have a frozen balance, it will display that frozen balance separately in the home screen.
