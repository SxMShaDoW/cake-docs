## Why do I need to activate certain products on a different website?

Some products require you activate the item on another website because of various terms and agreements with these providers.

## What fees are there?

Cake Pay products are sold at face value.

## Are there any limits?

Yes, there are limits. A single user can purchase a maximum of $3,000 per day and $10,000 per month. You may run into other limits, and limits are subject to change. If you need higher limits, please [email Cake Pay support](mailto:support@cakepay.com).

## Why is Cake Wallet showing a slightly different fiat value than the Cake Pay invoice amount?

Cake Wallet uses a different fiat API endpoint than the Cake Pay endpoint. This can lead to small (<1%) differences in prices shown. For non-USD denominated products, the spread may be a little larger because we buy the cards in USD, and there is thus an implied spread that Cake must pay between USD and the other fiat asset. Always make sure to send the exact amount of cryptocurrency specified for the invoice. Cake Pay uses extremely competitive market rates for crypto/USD.

## What are the Cake Pay terms and conditions?

## What cryptocurrencies can I pay with?

You can pay with Bitcoin and Monero natively. You can use the Trocador plugin to pay with other cryptocurrencies. Using this plugin may require manual processing, so expect an extra business day for processing.
