Obtanium is an Android app that helps install and update apps directly from various sources.

Obtanium can be installed by downloading the latest release from F-Droid, the [official website](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/) or the [Obtanium GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)

Once Obtanium is installed, you are able to add Cake Wallet via our repository.

After opening Obtanium, press the `Add App` button on the bottom bar. Then, paste the Cake Wallet repository URL [https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/) into the `App Source URL` field, then press the `Add` button.
