Bitcoin Cash `(BCH)` emerged from a fork of Bitcoin in August 2017, primarily to address scalability issues by increasing the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB, allowing for more transactions to be processed per block.

This alteration was intended to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, making it more practical for everyday use. Like Bitcoin, BCH operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology, but it promotes itself as "Bitcoin with bigger blocks" to differentiate from its predecessor by focusing on broader transaction throughput.

## Addresses

We automatically generate new Bitcoin Cash addresses after each use for better privacy. Previous addresses continue to work.

We use the same derivation scheme as Electrum: `m/0/x` for receive addresses, and `m/1/x` for change addresses.

## Seed format

We use the BIP39 seed format.
