Zano is an open-source cryptocurrency and ecosystem with enterprise-grade privacy, security, and scalability that operates as a robust foundation for confidential assets and decentralised applications (dApps).

## Addresses

In Cake Wallet's Zano wallet, there is only one address per wallet, which is standard for the Zano ecosystem. Keep in mind that this will have lesser privacy compared to some other assets, where new addresses are automatically generated.

Your Zano address will start with `Zx` followed by a series of alphanumeric characters.

## Seed Format

Cake Wallet uses a 26-word seed format for Zano wallets. When creating or restoring a wallet, you'll need to use this 26-word seed phrase.

## Fee Levels

Transaction fees are a necessary part of sending Zano or Confidential Assets. 

Cake Wallet offers three fee levels for transactions:

1. **Slow**: Cheaper but may take longer to confirm.
2. **Medium**: Recommended for most transactions. Balanced speed and cost.
3. **Fast**: Expensive but confirms quickly.

These fee levels are determined automatically using current network fee rates.

We recommend using the `Automatic` fee level under normal conditions for a good balance of speed and cost.

## Confidential Assets

Cake Wallet's Zano wallet can store Confidential Assets in addition to ZANO. To add a Confidential Asset, you'll need to navigate to the Home Screen Settings (shown to the right of `Zano` on the main screen) and then click the + to add a token. Any existing Confidential Assets owned by the wallet will automatically be shown on the home screen.
