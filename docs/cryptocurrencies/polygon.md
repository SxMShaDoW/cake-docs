Polygon `(MATIC)` is a Layer-2 network for Ethereum that is designed to support a much higher TPS (transactions per second) while having lower fees, along with some privacy enhancements.

## Addresses

In Cake Wallet's Polygon wallet, there is only one address per wallet, which is standard for the Polygon ecosystem. Keep in mind that this will have lesser privacy compared to some other assets, where new addresses are automatically generated.

Your Polygon address will start with `0x` followed by a series of alphanumeric characters.

## Seed Format

Cake Wallet uses a 12-word BIP39 seed format for Polygon wallets. When creating or restoring a wallet, you'll need to use this 12-word seed phrase or the private key. The derivation path used is `m/44'/60'/0'/0`.

## Fee Levels

Transaction fees are a necessary part of sending MATIC or ERC-20 tokens. 

MATIC is consumed as a 'gas' fee when making any transaction from an Polygon wallet. This also applies to sending ERC-20 tokens. For example, to send USDT, you need to pay a network fee in ETH, not USDT. Thus, sending 10 USDT will cost a certain amount of ETH, and the recipient will receive the full 10 USDT.

Cake Wallet offers three fee levels for transactions:

1. **Slow**: Cheaper but may take longer to confirm.
2. **Medium**: Recommended for most transactions. Balanced speed and cost.
3. **Fast**: Expensive but confirms quickly.

These fee levels are determined automatically using current network fee rates.

## Tokens

Cake Wallet's Polygon wallet can store ERC-20 tokens in addition to MATIC. Some common ERC-20 tokens such as USDC, USDT, and DAI are displayed by default. To show other ERC-20 tokens, you'll need to navigate to the Home Screen Settings (shown to the right of `Polygon` on the main screen) and enable them.

Other token types, as well as NFTs, are not currently supported; expanded support is planned for the future.

### Adding a new token

You can add a new ERC-20 token by navigating to the Home screen settings (shown to the right of `Polygon` on the main screen), then search for your desired token. Click to enable it.

If the token does not appear, then you can add the token by contract address. Paste the address of the custom token you wish to add, then click the `+` button.
