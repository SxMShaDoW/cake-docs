Tron `(TRX)` is a blockchain-based digital platform aimed at decentralizing the entertainment industry by allowing content creators to publish, store, and own data in a decentralized ecosystem. Founded by Justin Sun in 2017, Tron leverages its own cryptocurrency, TRX, for transactions within its ecosystem. The platform seeks to empower creators by cutting out middlemen, ensuring fair distribution of earnings through smart contracts, and providing high scalability and throughput for content sharing and digital asset transfers.

## Addresses

In Cake Wallet's Tron wallet, there is only one address per wallet, which is standard for the Tron ecosystem. Keep in mind that this will have lesser privacy compared to some other assets, where new addresses are automatically generated.

## Seed Format

12-word BIP39 seed type is generated for Tron wallets. When creating or restoring a wallet, you'll need to use this 12-word seed phrase or the private key. The derivation path used is `m/44'/60'/0'/0`.

## Tokens

Cake Wallet's Tron wallet can store extra tokens in addition to TRX. Some common tokens such as USDC, USDT, and DOGE are displayed by default. To show other tokens, you'll need to navigate to the Home Screen Settings (shown to the right of `Tron` on the main screen) and enable them.

Other token types, as well as NFTs, are not currently supported; expanded support is planned for the future.

### Adding a new token

You can add a new token by navigating to the Home screen settings (shown to the right of `Tron` on the main screen), then search for your desired token. Click to enable it.

If the token does not appear, then you can add the token by contract address. Paste the address of the custom token you wish to add, then click the `+` button.
