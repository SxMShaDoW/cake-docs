Nano `(XNO)`, formerly known as RaiBlocks, is a cryptocurrency designed for fast, feeless transactions. Launched in 2015, Nano uses a unique block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain, allowing for instant transaction confirmations. This setup eliminates the need for mining, reducing energy consumption and transaction fees, making it ideal for microtransactions and direct peer-to-peer payments. The consensus mechanism, Open Representative Voting (ORV), ensures security and prevents double-spending without the need for traditional mining or staking processes.

## Addresses

In Cake Wallet's Nano wallet, there is only one address per wallet, which is standard for the Nano ecosystem. Keep in mind that this will have lesser privacy compared to some other assets, where new addresses are automatically generated.

Your Nano address will start with `nano_` followed by a series of alphanumeric characters.
