## Addresses

In Cake Wallet's Nano wallet, there is only one address per wallet, which is standard for the Nano ecosystem. Keep in mind that this will have lesser privacy compared to some other assets, where new addresses are automatically generated.

Your Nano address will start with `nano_` followed by a series of alphanumeric characters.
