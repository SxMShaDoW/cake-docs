# Send funds

Always make sure that your wallet is fully synchronized before sending Monero.  

## You can send from the "Send" screen

To get to the send screen, tap `Send` on the balance screen. Then, you should paste a destination address (using the paste button, scanning QR code, or using Address book). After that, enter an amount in the active cryptocurrency or the active fiat currency. You can send all wallet funds using the `ALL` button. Below, you can change the fee priority. You can also make an internal note for any transaction. This note will be visible only in the Cake Wallet app. You can always change a note on the transaction details screen. After filling in all forms and pressing the `Send` button, an outgoing transaction will be created. You can confirm that your transaction was sent in your wallet's transaction history.

Note that the network fee is added to the transaction separately. So if your balance is 1 XMR, you are sending 0.5 XMR to someone, and the network fee is 0.01 XMR, then you will spend a total of 0.51 XMR for the transaction. If you send your entire balance by clicking the `ALL` button in the upper right, then the network fee will be deducted from the full balance. In the "Confirm sending" window, the total amount deducted from the wallet balance is the sum of the "Amount" and the "Fee" values.
