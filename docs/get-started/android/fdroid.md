!!! warning "Deprecation Warning"
    We have decided to deprecate our F-Droid repository (fdroid.cakelabs.com) due to some issues preventing us from updating to our latest releases.

If you would like to have a direct upgrade path *without* uninstalling Cake Wallet, you can do so by setting up [Obtanium](obtanium.md).

Otherwise, we recommend using [Accrescent](accrescent.md) for a more reliable update experience. However, this *will* require backing up all seeds and wallets (See [backup](/basic-features/create-backup.html)) and uninstalling Cake Wallet, then re-installing from Accrescent.
